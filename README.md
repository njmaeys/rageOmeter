Currently requires your riot api key to be placed at the root level of the project in a file called *riotApiKey.txt*. This file is in the .gitignore so it's not tracked in source control  

An example of a running script is in the src directory.  
- cd src  
- python summonerSimpleData.py  
- this will return a json object of simple data for the summoner you enter

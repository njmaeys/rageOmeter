How tilted will she get?

Currently requires your riot api key to be placed at the root level of the project in a file called *riotApiKey.txt*. This file is in the .gitignore so it's not tracked in source control  

An example of a running script is in the src directory.  
- cd src  
- python parseInGameData.py  
- this will print/return data from the current game of the summoner name you enetered  
-- if there is not current game data will print a message stating summoner is not in game
